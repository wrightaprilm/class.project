# An Introduction to My R Package
### A bit smaller

My R package is very _**useful**_ and it does _three_ things. 
We can go on to a new line.

This shall be a new paragraph.

```{r}
sum(1, 4)
```

## Installation Instructions 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
install.packages("phytools")
# But if you include text in a code chunk, it must be commented
```

We can include text anywhere in the document.
